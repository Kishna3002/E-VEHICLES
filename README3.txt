# FS22_EnhancedVehicle

**Direct download: [FS22_EnhancedVehicle.zip](https://github.com/ZhooL/FS22_EnhancedVehicle/releases/latest/download/FS22_EnhancedVehicle.zip)**

This is a modification for Farming Simulator 22. It adds a "track assistant" ("GPS") and a "snap to driving direction" feature, a parking brake, differential locks, wheel drive modes and improved hydraulics controls to your vehicle. It also shows more vehicle details on the HUD.

## What this mod does
* When the game starts, it changes all "motorized" and "controllable" vehicles on the map to default settings: wheel drive mode to "all-wheel (4WD)" and deactivation of both differentials.
* Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad /</kbd> to open the config dialog.
* Press <kbd>R Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> to enable the snap to direction or snap to track assistant.
  * Press & hold <kbd>R Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> one second or longer to disable the snap & track assistant completely.
* Press <kbd>R Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>End</kbd> to keep your vehicle driving in the current direction or on the current track.
  * Press <kbd>R Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd> to reverse snap/track direction (e.g. to turn around at end of field).
* Press <kbd>R Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad 2</kbd> to calculate a track layout based on current vehicle direction and implement working width.
  * If you now enable snap mode the vehicle will drive on the current marked track.
  * Press <kbd>R Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad 4/6</kbd> to adjust the turnover track number (from -5 to 5).
  * Configure headland behavior in configuration menu or via keys.
* Press <kbd>R Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Numpad 1</kbd> to (re-)calculate the working width. This will not change the current track layout.
* Press <kbd>Numpad Enter</kbd> to put your vehicle in parking mode. It won't move an inch in this mode.
* On HUD it displays:
  * (When snap/track is enabled) The current snap to angle and current track and turnover number.
  * Damage values in % for controlled vehicle and all its attachments.
  * Fuel fill level for Diesel/AdBlue/Electric/Methane and the current fuel usage rate<sup>1</sup>.
  * The current status of the differential locks and wheel drive mode.
  * The current engine RPM and temperature<sup>1</sup>.
  * The current mass of the vehicle and the total mass of vehicle and all its attachments and loads.
* Keybindings can be changed in the game options menu.

**<sup>1</sup> In multiplayer games, all clients, except the host, won't display the fuel usage rate and engine temperature correctly due to GIANTS Engine limitations**

## What this mod doesn't (fully) do
* Work on consoles. Buy a PC for proper gaming.
